# Task 03: Classic Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a fun and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React (or Next.js) and styled with Tailwind CSS. It was created as the third task for the SkillCraft Technology web development internship. The game features a clean interface, win detection, and a reset option.



## ‚ú® Features

* **Interactive Game Board:** A classic 3x3 grid where two players can compete.
* **Player Turns:** The game clearly indicates whose turn it is ("X" or "O").
* **Win Detection:** Automatically detects when a player has won the game by getting three in a row, column, or diagonal.
* **Draw Detection:** Recognizes when the game is a draw and no more moves can be made.
* **Game Status Display:** A clear status message shows the current player, the winner, or if the game is a draw.
* **Reset Functionality:** A "Play Again" button allows users to reset the board and start a new game at any time.
* **Responsive Design:** The game is fully playable and looks great on all devices.
